Ruleset A) D6 twin pool 
- roll # of D6 equal to Stat (roll 1)
- add a static # = to skill 
- total them
- roll # of D6 equal to difficulty and difficulty modifiers
- subtract roll from total.
if total is positive success on the following variations
- if net total is less than negative pool basic sucess
- if net total positive is equal to or higher than negative pool induce a critical sucess effect
- effects can be increased based on number of times the total loops over
if total is negative failure on the following variations
- if net total negative is less than positive dice pool, minor failure
- if net total negative is more than positive dice pool, critical failure effect
- effects cumulative
effects vary based on type of roll


Ruleset B) upgrading pool
die step based on stat, die number based on skill (similar to Deadlands RPG) die type is upgraded once per stat level starting at d3
- a stat roll is treated as a skill roll using the stat (dtype) (D#) combined
- skip d7, d9, and d 11, stop at d-12
- difficulty a static number unless opposed
- dice can explode based on reaching maximum number
- doubling the difficulty gives similar critical effect to prior system
- failing a roll total the 1s rolled each one induces a similar critical failure effect to the prior system

Ruleset C - single pool hit/miss
- roll d10 = to skill and stat
- roll against a static DC
- each 1 and 2 count against the total
- each 10, 9, and 8 countnt as  hits
- possibility for a 7 to count as a hit or 3 to count as a miss based on difficulty factor
- difficulty factor is the static difficulty compared to the skill, if one is double or more the factor increases in that side's favour
- if the result fails each 1 adds to critical miss effects
- if the result succeeds each 8 adds to critical sucess effects
