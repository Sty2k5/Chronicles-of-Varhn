Gods are the embodiement and personification of a concept
the older and broader a concept the higher up the god is.
the immutable concepts are personified by the most powerful gods.

when a new god comes into being it creates an upheaval

The older god have an understanding of how they came into existance
the newer gods are aware but not to the same degree

creation is the oldest of dieties 
death is the second
life is the third
fourth is peace
fifth is war
sixth is time
seventh is law
eighth is Chaos
light and dark are nineth
and tenth is eternity
