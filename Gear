Weapons

Arming sword - often mistitled a "Longsword" the arming sword is a one handed slashing and peircing weapon which can also be used to pommel strike making it exceptionally versatile in the right hands, these are seen as an archaiac and anachronistic choice

Longsword often mistitled as a "greatsword" though it encompasses such bulky weapons, a longsword is, simply put, a sword that is too long in blade and handle to be held with one hand as effectively and often utilizes both hands for all but the strongest of weilders. a longsword in current era Varhn is a long thin bladed implement such as a sciovana or a straightsword, though anachronistic varieties such as the hand-and-a-half sword, or the traditional Knight's longsword are still used in places.

straightsword - a term for a sword that is thicker in blade than a rapier or smallsword, a straightsword is as much a cutting tool as it is a peircing tool varieties such as the cutlass and sabre which, though curved, provide the same function exist.

Rapier- a thinner bladed sword with excellent reach and speed, its speed only rivalled by the smallsword, the rapier is the fencing weapon of choice in most societies.

smallsword- to call this a blade would barely be accurate, though it has an edge it is not a viable cutting implement due to it's narrow profile. however, its reach and peircing ability are second only to the rapier, which the smallsword's speed and agility outclass.
